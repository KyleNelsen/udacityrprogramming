Overview
================================

This is my project for the R Programming Course part of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. It involves coming up with 3 questions on the datasets and using analysis and visualizations with R to answer them. There are 3 datasets which hold bikeshare user data from major cities in the US. The 3 cities are New York City, Washington DC and Chicago.

The 3 questions I came up with were:

-Which stations are the most popular?

-What is the gender breakdown of users per city?

-What is the averege trip duration by birth year?

I included the visualizations in the Images folder
